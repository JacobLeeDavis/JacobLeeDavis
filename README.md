## Jacob Lee Davis
I recently graduated from Belmont University in Nashville, TN with a business degree, but I have been a coding enthusiast since childhood. Like everyone, games drew me in at an early age. I learned c/c++ and assembly as well as 3d maths in the early 2000s. I also learned python as a way to get an early version of blender to export my model files. I walked away from tech for a long time, but now I am back. More recently, starting during COVID, I enjoyed wasting a lot of time doing Z80 assembly for the TI-84 calculators. Brushed up on javascript as well. Now I am just looking for good projects to contribute to so I can build up a more public body of work and hunt for freelance jobs.
